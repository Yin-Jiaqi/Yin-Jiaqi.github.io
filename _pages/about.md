I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Cunxi Yu. My research focuses on **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**, with particular interests in:

- **Logic Synthesis** and **Formal Verification**
- **High-Level Synthesis** and scheduling algorithms
- **Combinatorial Optimization** for hardware design
- **Equality Saturation** techniques for circuit optimization

## Research Highlights

My recent work explores the intersection of traditional EDA algorithms. I have developed several frameworks including:

- **BoolE**: Symbolic reasoning via Boolean equality saturation (DAC 2025, **Best Paper Nomination**)
- **RESPECT**: Reinforcement learning-based scheduling for edge TPUs (DAC 2023)
- **HEC**: Equivalence verification for code transformation (USENIX ATC 2025)

## Education

**PhD in Computer Engineering**
University of Maryland, College Park  
Advisor: Prof. Cunxi Yu

**MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering**
The Ohio State University

**BS in Communication Engineering**
Harbin Engineering University

## Experience

**Cadence Design Systems** - Graduate Intern (May 2025 - August 2025)  
Worked on Genus Development team

**Pacific Northwest National Laboratory** - Graduate Intern (June 2023 - August 2023)  
Contributed to SODA-OPT Optimization project for MLIR system design tools

## Awards
